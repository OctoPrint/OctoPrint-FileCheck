# File Check

The File Check plugin tries to detect common issues in uploaded files that are known to cause
issues while printing and which in the past have caused support requests on OctoPrint's Community
Forums.

It currently detects and warns about the following issues:

  * Outdated placeholder `{travel_speed}` left in the GCODE generated by the slicer. See
    [here](https://faq.octoprint.org/file-check-travel-speed) for details on this.

## Setup

The plugin is part of the core dependencies of OctoPrint 1.4.1+ and will be installed automatically alongside it.

In case you want to manually install it into an older version for whatever reason, install via the bundled
[Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

"Your file still contains a place holder <code>{travel_speed}</code>. This"

"<code>{speed_travel}</code> at some point and no longer gets replaced in "
"current versions. You need to fix this in your slicer and reslice your "

"in OctoPrint, as it might have been leaked by your slicer to third "
"parties through any GCODE files shared previously."

"Your sliced file still contains a place holder "
"<code>{travel_speed}</code>. This is a common issue when using old "
"start/stop GCODE code snippets in current versions of Cura, as the "
"placeholder name switched to <code>{speed_travel}</code> at some point "
"and no longer gets replaced in current versions. You need to fix this in "
